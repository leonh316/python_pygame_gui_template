# python_pygame_gui_template
Very simple GUI written in python using pygame.

# Version

- Currently the minimal viable product I quickly hacked together to satisfiy my own need of a simple GUI in python that is customizable.
- FUTURE: Will rewrite the code according to best practices.

# Installation

- Download or Git clone this repository into a local folder.
- pip, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Launching

- Launch the GUI(graphical user interface) template by opening a terminal.
- change directory to where main.py is located. e.g  ```C:\github\python_pygame_gui_template\```
- run ```python main.py``` in the terminal and app will run.

# Credits
